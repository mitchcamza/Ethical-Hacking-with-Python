0. import required modules
    import scapy.all as scapy
    from scapy.layers import http


1. create a sniff function that takes one argument
    use scapy.sniff with 4 arguments:
        1. iface=interface # the interface we will be using
        2. store=False # don't store the information in the memory (saves system resources)
        3. prn=proccess_sniffed_packet # specifies a call-back function 
        (executes a function every time this function is called)
        4. filter="" # (optional argument) - filters packets according to ip protocol or port number


2. define a proccess_sniffed_packet function that takes the packet as an argument
    check if the packet has an HTTPRequest layer (same as filter param)
        if so, print the packet


3. call the sniff function from the main function and parse the interface as an argument (eg. eth0)
